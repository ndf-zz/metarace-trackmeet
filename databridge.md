# Trackmeet "Databridge" Schema

*Updated: 2025-10-14*


## Overview

Trackmeet Databridge is a loose collection of data objects
that convey information about a meet, competitions, competitors
and results for overlay on graphic displays. All data endpoints are
communicated as JSON-encoded objects, via MQTT (telegraph)
or HTTP.


## Definitions

   - Meet: A whole championship is considered a single "meet".
     A meet comprises several sessions of events which together
     determine results for a number of competitions over a
     set of competitor categories.
   - Competition: A type of race or award for which there is a prize
     at the meet. Eg: Scratch Race, Points Race, Individual Pursuit, Sprint
   - Competitor: A single rider, a Madison pair or a team of riders. [1]
   - Category: A competitor's category
     Eg: ME "Men Elite", WE "Women Elite", MJ "Men Junior",
     PARA "Para-cycling", M15 "Men Under 15", W17 "Women Under 17" [2,3]
   - Phase: Within a competition, phases progress competitors
     toward a final result. The final phase of a competition
     will be labelled "Final" in the subtitle. [4,5]
   - Contest: Where a phase of competition requires more than one
     result to decide the outcome, each result is assigned a contest.
     Eg: "Sprint at 10 laps to go" for a points race or
     "1-6 Final" for a Keirin. [5]
   - Heat: If a contest requires more than one outcome to determine
     the result, each individual outcome will be decided by a heat [5,6]
   - Path: A slash delimited list identifying a meet, category,
     competition, phase, contest, and heat. [5,6]
   - Startlist: A list of competitors and their qualifying information
     (where relevant) that will be expected to start a
     competition fragment.
   - Result: A summary of the outcomes of a competition fragment,
     or a virtual standing if the result is partially determined.
   - Event: A heat, contest or phase on the meet schedule
     identified uniquely by a short string, usually numeric. Eg:
     38 "Event 38: W15 Sprint Semi Final Heat 3, if required"
     An event may reference more than one specific path, and include
     multiple competition fragments.
   - Fragment: A competition, phase, contest or heat.
   - Session: An ordered list of events to be held sequentially as part of
     the meet, identified by a short string, usually numeric.
     Eg: 1 "Day 1, Morning Session" [7]
   - Schedule of events: An ordered list of sessions that make up the
     entire meet.
   - Index of events: A mapping between event IDs, sessions and 
     the associated category, competition, phase and fragments.
   - Current event: The event ID and unique meet path for the current
     action on the track and its associated competition fragment.
   - Home Straight: The home straight is on the same side as the finish line.
   - Back Straight: The back straight is on the opposite side to
     the home straight.
   - A/B Competitor: For timed events with two competitors on the track
     (pursuit, time trial, team sprint, team pursuit) The "A"
     competitor refers to the home straight, and "B" to the back
     straight. A/B finish lines are marked with a half-length white line
     positioned in the middle of the respective straight.
   - Place/Placing: A competitor that completes an event, or that is
     assigned a finish, will be allocated a placing by officials. Placed
     competitors are ranked according to their assigned places.
   - Ranking: Order (number) of a competitor's result in an event. [8]
   - Classification: A competition overall result (eg "Sprint Final
     Classification") or a result assigned to a competitor in an event.
     For a placed competitor, this will be a place number with a
     trailing period (eg 1. 3. 21.) or in-text an ordinal number (eg 1st,
     2nd, 3rd etc). Unplaced competitors will be classified as non-starters,
     non-finishers, abandoned or disqualified with a classification code:
     dns, dnf, abd, dsq (respectively).
   - Relegation: A competitor's placing may be altered due to
     conduct in the event, usually to last place in the heat/contest.
     A relegation does not disqualify a competitor, and there may be
     no mention in the result why the relegation occurred.
   - Medals: The 1st, 2nd and 3rd placed competitors in a competition
     will be awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze medals (respectively).
   - Title/Champion: The best-placed Australian competitor in a
     competition will be awarded the Australian title. Eg:
     Elite Men Sprint Australian Champion.

Notes:

   1. Competition type determines whether competitors are riders,
      pairs or teams.
   2. Para-cyclists will be assigned an additional sport class
      based on impairment, eg MC2 "Men Cycle 2", WB "Women Tandem",
      multiple sport classes may be present in a single competition.
   3. Tandem para-cyclists are individual competitors with an
      associated pilot rider. Pilot details are usually displayed
      on results and startlists immediately under the rider. A pilot's
      competitor ID is the same as their rider.
   4. Any competition with one or more events on the meet schedule
      will have at least one phase.
   5. Where phases, contests or heats do not apply to a competition,
      they are omitted. A competition with no events or one that
      is determined by other means will have no phases.
   6. Phases of competition with heats but no contests will have their
      heat field collapsed into contest. In that case, the contests
      will be labelled as heats. Eg: 2024atc/ME/ip/qualifying/3 "Men Elite
      Individual Pursuit Qualifying Heat 3"
   7. Warm-ups, breaks and presentations may be included as
      session entries, but they will not reference a path in the meet.
   8. All competitors present in a result are assigned a ranking,
      even if currently not classified. Rankings may not
      align exactly with places, and they may be duplicated.
      The order of display of result lines is provided by the
      array structure in the result object.


## Display Conventions

Cycling startlists and results should adhere to the following conventions:

   - Rider last (family) name should be presented all uppercase.
   - Rider first (given) name should be presented mixed case.
   - For Australian events, names should be presented First LAST.
   - Classifications are left-aligned and will always have a trailing period
     eg: '1.', '2.' unless they are one of the special values:
     'dns', 'dnf', 'abd' or 'dsq'.
   - A virtual classification, eg during qualifying or for an intermediate
     time split should be surrounded with parentheses: (3.), italicised: *3.*,
     or formatted in such a way that is is obviously not a confirmed place.
     Places are confirmed when then fragment status is 'provisional' or
     'final'.
   - **Rider numbers should never be displayed with a trailing period.**
     When displayed in a column, they should be right-aligned.
   - The "number" column on team results should be omitted to
     simplify readability. Team competitor IDs are for internal
     reference only.
   - Result times, down times, points should be right-aligned
   - State affiliations are shown in parentheses () next to a
     rider name, and may be omitted for space.
   - Where an event includes additional information, it should be
     included in a right-aligned column to the left of the result column
